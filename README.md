Java Battleship Game: Sea Serpent Edition
=========================================

Dive into the depths of Java programming with this console-based battleship game, featuring the mythical sea serpents as your primary adversaries. Set sail across a digital ocean, strategize your moves, and target the serpents lurking beneath the waves. This game offers a classic twist on the traditional battleship experience, challenging players to remember their hits and misses while managing multiple targets.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   Java for game logic and console interaction
-   Java `Random` class for generating serpent positions
-   Java `Scanner` class for user input

Lessons Learned
---------------

1.  Java Basics

    -   Utilized arrays to store the positions of the sea serpents and track player guesses.
    -   Employed loops (`for`, `while`) to iterate over game states, validate user input, and update game status.
2.  Object-Oriented Programming

    -   Defined classes to model the game's entities: `GameUser` for player data, `ComplexGameSerpent` and `SimpleGameSerpent` for enemy units.
    -   Implemented encapsulation by keeping game data and methods within their respective classes and exposing only necessary information.
3.  Conditional Logic

    -   Applied conditional statements to evaluate game conditions, such as hit detection, game over criteria, and input validation.
    -   Crafted a dynamic game flow that reacts to player actions and game events, providing immediate feedback on game progress.
